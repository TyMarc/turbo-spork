## Solution details

We approached the challenge with a hackothon mindset. We wanted to get as much basic features as possible without shooting ourselves in the foot so that we could have enough time and room to innovate once we got a spark for something. That's how the "Tinder-Like" viewing of messages came to life!

We didn't invest a lot of love into the backends. We prefered showing some cool interactions in the mobile applications and we didn't feel like debugging nodejs callback hell! :)

Super fun competition overall, the Mirego router really saved our ass since we didn't have to setup any annoying network rules. We feel we gave a good twist to the basic Snapchat application but we would have liked to spend additional time to really step it up a notch (Better Person to Person communication and UX, implementing the communication in a secure way since at ETS we <3 Security, etc...)

We're still really proud of the overall feel to the application, the theme that was provided really shined when it came to implementing our pickers and fragments (Great job btw!). 

We didn't really have any real blockers but the nodejs application could have been one had we decided to invest into it. Generally we're bigger fans of Python backends :)
